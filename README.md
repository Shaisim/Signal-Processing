# Signal-Processing Project

Hello,

This project was done as a part of signal processing course.
In this project we received "dirty" signal with eco and noises and the goal was to clean the signal with adaptive FIR filters that based on LMS and RLS algorithms.

*Signal-Processing.pdf is the project report. The report was written in hebrew*
