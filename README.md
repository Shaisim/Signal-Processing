# Signal-Processing Project

Hello,

This project was done as a part of signal processing course.
In this project we received "dirty" signal with eco and noises that have been cleaned by using adaptive FIR filters that based on LMS and RLS algorithms.
This project was written in MATLAB.



*Signal-Processing.pdf is the project report. The report was written in hebrew*
